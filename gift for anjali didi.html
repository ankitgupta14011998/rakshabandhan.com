	<p>Our mother gave birth to me, but you raised me like a second mommy-- being happy in my small endeavours and correcting me at every point of life, your hand was always there on my head. Whenever I kept secrets from our mother, your motherly soul would always come to know the deeply buried secrets. I still wonder, How? But, I am profoundly grateful for all the times you saved me from the scoldings of our mother by pulling my ear, advising me, and making me promise I wouldn’t repeat the same because If I do, you will tell me your guidance, words of wisdom has been the beacon of light that illuminated my life, and I couldn’t Thank You enough for it.</p>

    <p>Over this letter to sister on Raksha Bandhan, I would like to Thank You for a zillion things that I haven’t till now. Thank you for not only sharing your stationary, and belongings with me, but for being a part of my sorrows, downfalls, and days of darkness. At times, you were not with me in my happy times, but you were always there with me in my lows. Even though we are separated by boundaries, you are just a call away when I need you. Thank You for wiping my tears and making me smile as a friend does. Thank You for saving me from the everything. From teasing me to remote fights to annoying me with little things. I found naughty, supportive, helping, loving sister. I can write lengths about how obliged I feel to have a sister who is my brother and mother, both. Thank You, Bhagwanji and Badi Mumma for such a precious gift.</p>

    <p>Lastly, Didi, Whatever, I am today it is all because of your love, pampering, and scolding. You have been the perfect sister everyone wishes to have; I was just a bit Lucky! From childhood to teenage years to today when we are apart from each other in different rooms; we have laughed, cried, fought, and have made many memories. All memories and moments are beautiful because they had you with me. Your love gave me the strength to break the rakhi stereotypes of tying a rakhi thread to a brother. Because, you are my sister, mother, and everything.</p>
